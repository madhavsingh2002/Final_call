Here are 10 questions and answers about Flutter's MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

### 1. **What is MVC?**
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, an architecture pattern that separates the application into three main components: 
the Model (data), the View (UI), and the Controller (logic).

### 2. **What is the role of the Model in MVC?**
The Model represents the data and business logic of the application.
It is responsible for managing the data, including retrieving, storing, and updating it.

### 3. **What is the role of the View in MVC?**
The View is responsible for displaying the data provided by the Model. 
It defines the UI and how the user sees and interacts with the application.

### 4. **What is the role of the Controller in MVC?**
The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. 
It handles user input, updates the Model, and determines which View to display based on the data.

### 5. **How does the View interact with the Controller in MVC?**
The View sends user interactions (like button clicks) to the Controller. 
The Controller processes these inputs, updates the Model if necessary, and then updates the View.

### 6. **How is data passed from Model to View in MVC?**
Data is passed from the Model to the View through the Controller. 
The Controller fetches data from the Model and provides it to the View for display.

### 7. **Why is MVC beneficial in Flutter?**
MVC helps in organizing code by separating concerns, making it easier to manage complex applications, 
and allowing independent development and testing of the Model, View, and Controller.

### 8. **How do you handle user interactions in MVC?**
User interactions are handled by the Controller. The Controller processes the input, updates the Model, and 
refreshes the View to reflect any changes.

### 9. **Which part of the MVC architecture is responsible for business logic?**
The business logic in MVC is typically handled by the Model, while the Controller may contain some logic related to handling user 
input and updating the View.

### 10. **How do you test an MVC architecture in Flutter?**
Testing in MVC involves writing unit tests for the Model (business logic), integration tests for the Controller (input handling), 
and UI tests for the View to ensure it displays data correctly.
