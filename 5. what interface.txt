An interface in programming is a way to define a contract that a class must follow. 
It specifies a set of methods and properties that a class needs to implement, 
but it doesnâ€™t provide the actual code for these methods. 
The class that implements the interface provides the specific details on how the methods should work.

In Dart, every class can act as an interface. When you use the `implements` keyword, 
you're telling the class to provide its own implementation for the methods and properties defined by the interface.

### Simple Example:

```dart
// Interface (can be any class)
class Vehicle {
  void start();
  void stop();
}

// Implementing the interface
class Car implements Vehicle {
  @override
  void start() {
    print('Car is starting');
  }

  @override
  void stop() {
    print('Car is stopping');
  }
}

void main() {
  Car myCar = Car();
  myCar.start(); // Car is starting
  myCar.stop();  // Car is stopping
}
```

### Summary:
- **Interface:** Defines a set of methods and properties.
- **Implementation:** The class that implements the interface provides the specific details for those methods and properties.
- **Purpose:** To ensure that different classes follow the same method signatures, allowing for consistency and interoperability.
